## 📖 About

Anova (short for "Analysis of variants") automates design specifications as data by analyzing a selected Figma component or component set.

The plugin conducts an "analysis of variants" to audit component composition, visual styling, and property configurations. While the name and concept alludes to traditional analysis of variance in statistics, the plugin returns a deterministic, repeatable, succinct and comprehensive result. To learn more, read the [Analysis of Variants blog post](https://nathanacurtis.substack.com/p/analysis-of-variants-9e440c30b93e).
