# Anova Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Types and Schema Are the Same Contract (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
`@directededges/anova` publishes two interlinked artifacts: TypeScript types in `types/` and JSON schemas in `schema/`. They MUST describe the same structure at all times.

- Every type in `types/` has a corresponding definition (direct or via reference) in `schema/component.schema.json` or its siblings. Changes to one MUST be reflected in the other before publishing.
- The JSON schemas are the authoritative validation contract for serialized output. The TypeScript types are the authoritative compile-time contract for code consuming that output.
- Neither artifact may drift ahead of the other. Misalignment is a bug.

Rationale: Every consumer (`anova-transformer`, `anova-kit`, `anova-plugin`) relies on both the TypeScript types for compilation and the JSON schemas for runtime validation. Drift between the two causes silent contract violations across all downstream packages.

### II. No Logic — Types and Schema Only
This package MUST NOT contain transformation logic, processing algorithms, or runtime behavior beyond:
- `DEFAULT_CONFIG` constant exported from `Config.ts`
- `isReferenceValue` type-guard exported from `ReferenceValue.ts`

All other exports MUST be pure type declarations (`type`, `interface`) or static schema files. No classes, no functions, no async operations.

Rationale: `@directededges/anova` is the shared language definition for the Anova ecosystem. Embedding logic couples all consumers to implementation decisions that belong in `anova-transformer` or `anova-kit`. If logic is needed, it belongs in a downstream package.

### III. Minimal, Stable, Intentional Public API
The exports from `types/index.ts` are the full public API. Every exported type is a contract with every consumer.

- New types require explicit justification: they MUST represent a genuine, shared concept in the Anova spec — not an internal implementation detail of any one package.
- Removing or renaming an exported type or a named field within a type is a breaking change and MUST follow semantic versioning.
- Schema exports (via `exports` in `package.json`) are equally contractual — adding, removing, or restructuring a schema file is a breaking change.
- `DEFAULT_CONFIG` and `isReferenceValue` are the only permitted runtime exports; adding more requires constitutional amendment.

Rationale: All downstream packages compile against these types. Any change has a multiplied impact across `anova-transformer`, `anova-kit`, and `anova-plugin` simultaneously.

### IV. Schema Validity Must Be Mechanically Verifiable
The JSON schemas in `schema/` MUST be valid JSON Schema (Draft 7 or the declared draft).

- Schemas MUST be linted or validated as part of any change that touches `schema/`.
- `component.schema.json` is the primary schema and MUST match the `Component` type tree rooted in `types/Component.ts`.
- `styles.schema.json`, `components.schema.json`, and `root.schema.json` MUST remain internally consistent with `component.schema.json`.
- `reference/styles.yaml` is a reference data file, not a schema. Do not conflate the two.

Rationale: Downstream tools perform runtime validation against these schemas. An invalid or inconsistent schema silently passes TypeScript compilation but breaks all runtime validation consumers.

### V. Type Safety — No Implicit Any, Strict Mode
All TypeScript in `types/` MUST compile under strict mode with zero errors.

- `any` is forbidden without an inline justification comment.
- All type relationships must be explicit; structural `any`-escape hatches erode the schema contract.
- `tsconfig.build.json` governs compilation; it MUST NOT weaken `strict` settings.

Rationale: These types are a published contract. Loose typing undermines compilation safety for every consumer and masks schema drift.

## Additional Constraints & Standards

- **Language/Tooling**: TypeScript strict mode (`tsconfig.build.json`); ESM only; no runtime dependencies permitted (devDependencies: `typescript` only).
- **Build**: `tsc -p tsconfig.build.json` emits `.js` shims into `dist/`. The source of truth is `types/*.ts` — `dist/` is a compatibility artifact only.
- **No test framework required** for a pure types/schema package, but schema consistency checks and type compilation serve as the quality gate.
- **Published files**: `dist/`, `types/`, `schema/`, `LICENSE`, `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`. Do not add files to the `files` array without justification.
- **Versioning**: `MAJOR` for any breaking change to a type signature, field name, field presence, or schema structure. `MINOR` for additive types or new optional fields. `PATCH` for documentation, comments, or formatting.
- **CHANGELOG.md** MUST be updated for every publish. Downstream consumers use it to evaluate upgrade cost.
- **`specs/` directory**: Feature work tracked under `specs/` follows the Spec Kit workflow. No spec output should be committed to `types/` or `schema/` without passing the Constitution Check.

## Development Workflow & Quality Gates

- Intent-First Flow: Use Spec Kit commands to structure work:
  - `/speckit.constitution` → uphold/modify these rules as the project evolves
  - `/speckit.specify` → define the feature's user intents and acceptance scenarios
  - `/speckit.plan` → capture architecture choices respecting this constitution
  - `/speckit.tasks` → generate actionable tasks honoring gates below
  - `/speckit.implement` → execute tasks in alignment with plan and constraints

- Constitution Check (MUST PASS before implementation):
  1. Change introduces only types, type-guards, constants, or schema — no algorithms or async logic.
  2. Every type added or changed has a corresponding schema update (or a documented, justified exception).
  3. Every schema change has a corresponding type update.
  4. `tsc -p tsconfig.build.json` exits with zero errors after the change.
  5. No new runtime dependencies added to `package.json`.
  6. Breaking changes are versioned `MAJOR`; additive changes `MINOR`; non-semantic changes `PATCH`. CHANGELOG updated.

- Reviews MUST verify each gate; violations require written justification and an explicit follow-up task.

## Governance

- **Authority**: This constitution governs development of `@directededges/anova` and supersedes conflicting ad-hoc practices.
- **Amendments**: Propose changes via PR with: rationale, impact analysis (which downstream packages are affected and how), and migration plan.
- **Versioning Policy (for this constitution)**:
  - MAJOR: Backward-incompatible governance/principle changes or removals.
  - MINOR: New principle/section or materially expanded guidance.
  - PATCH: Clarifications, wording, formatting; no semantic change.
- **Compliance**: Reviewers MUST check Constitution Check items at every feature milestone and before any `MAJOR` or `MINOR` package version bump.
