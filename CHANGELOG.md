## [0.5.0] - 2025-12-29

### Added

- **Instance of attribute**: Added optional `instanceOf` property to element definitions
  - Indicates the component or component set name that an instance element references
  - Only present for instance elements (Figma INSTANCE nodes)
  - Shows ComponentSet name for variant instances, or Component name for standalone instances
  - Also added to anatomy element definitions

- **Text property**: Added optional `text` property to element definitions
  - Contains the text content for text elements
  - Can be a string value or a `ReferenceValue` when bound to a text prop

- **Unified property bindings**: Property bindings now appear as `$ref` values on their natural properties
  - `children` can now be a `ReferenceValue` (for slot content bindings)
  - `instanceOf` can now be a `ReferenceValue` (for instance swap bindings)
  - `visible` style can now be a `ReferenceValue` (for boolean prop bindings)
  - `text` can be a `ReferenceValue` (for text prop bindings)
  - Added `ReferenceValue` definition with `$ref` JSON pointer to props

### Removed

- **propBindings section**: Removed separate `propBindings` property from elements
  - Bindings are now represented directly on their target properties using `$ref`

## [0.4.0] - 2025-12-27

### Added

- **Layout structure**: Added optional `layout` property to variant definitions that provides hierarchical element structure as a nested tree
  - Layout represents element nesting relationships in a recursive format
  - Leaf nodes are strings (element names)
  - Parent nodes are objects with element name as key and children array as value
  - Example: `{ "parentElement": ["childA", { "childB": ["grandchild"] }] }`
  
### Changed

- Schema now supports both structure representations:
  - New: `layout` at variant level (hierarchical tree)
  - Existing: `parent` and `children` properties in each element (maintained for backward compatibility)
  
### Deprecated

- `included` property has been removed from element definitions
  - Element inclusion is now determined by presence in the `layout` tree
  - Elements not present in `layout` are considered excluded from that variant
